## 2. Time Series

Projects focused on time-series analysis, forecasting, and temporal pattern recognition.

| Project Name | Tools | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [Stock Price Prediction with NLinear & RDLinear with HMM Regime Switching](Long-Time%20Series-Forecast%20with%20RevIN%20and%20Regime%20Switch)| Linear, DLinear, HMM, RevIN | This project implemented state-of-the-art Time Series Decomposition Linear Models. The results show that the overall performance of RDLinear with Reversible Instance Normalization achieved best performance with adaptive Regime Market. |
| [Transformer + LSTM/GRU for Vietnamese Stocks Price Prediction](https://github.com/dalzihn/TI_Final) | Attention, LSTM, GRU | This project explored the combination of Attention mechanism and Recurrent backbone such as LSTM/GRU. The results shows that with Attention, the performance of these variants increase about 5-10% with lower error metrics|
